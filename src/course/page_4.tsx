                <p>The geological time scale encompasses the history of the Earth. It is bracketed at the earliest by
                    the
                    dates of the first Solar System material at 4.567 Ga (or 4.567 billion years ago) and the formation
                    of
                    the Earth at 4.54 Ga (4.54 billion years), which is the beginning of the informally recognized
                    Hadean eon – a division of geological time. At the later end of the scale, it is marked by the
                    present day
                    (in the Holocene epoch).</p>
                <h2>Timescale of the Earth</h2>
                <p>The following five timelines show the geologic time scale. The first shows the entire time from the
                    formation
                    of the Earth to the present, but this gives little space for the most recent eon. Therefore, the
                    second
                    timeline shows an expanded view of the most recent eon. In a similar way, the most recent era is
                    expanded in
                    the third timeline, the most recent period is expanded in the fourth timeline, and the most recent
                    epoch is
                    expanded in the fifth timeline.</p>
