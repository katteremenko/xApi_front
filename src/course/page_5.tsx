                <h2>Relative dating</h2>
                <p>Methods for relative dating were developed when geology first emerged as a natural science.
                    Geologists still
                    use the following principles today as a means to provide information about geological history and
                    the timing
                    of geological events.
                </p>
                <p>The principle of uniformitarianism states that the geological processes observed in operation that
                    modify the
                    Earth's crust at present have worked in much the same way over geological time. A fundamental
                    principle
                    of geology advanced by the 18th-century Scottish physician and geologist James Hutton is that "the
                    present
                    is the key to the past." In Hutton's words: "the past history of our globe must be explained by what
                    can be
                    seen to be happening now."
                </p>
                <p>The principle of intrusive relationships concerns crosscutting intrusions. In geology, when an
                    igneous
                    intrusion cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock, it can be determined that the igneous
                    intrusion is
                    younger than the sedimentary rock. Different types of intrusions include stocks, laccoliths,
                    batholiths,
                    sills and dikes.
                </p>
                <p>The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the
                    sequences
                    through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found
                    that
                    penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older
                    than the
                    fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these
                    situations
                    may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.
                </p>
                <p>The principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or
                    clasts) are
                    found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For
                    example,
                    in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included
                    in a
                    newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign
                    bodies
                    are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a
                    result,
                    xenoliths are older than the rock that contains them.
                </p>
                <p>The principle of original horizontality states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially
                    horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of
                    environments
                    supports this generalization (although cross-bedding is inclined, the overall orientation of
                    cross-bedded
                    units is horizontal).
                </p>
                <p>The principle of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed
                    sequence is
                    younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot
                    slip
                    beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a
                    form of the
                    vertical timeline, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest
                    layer to
                    deposition of the highest bed.
                </p>
                <p>The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As
                    organisms
                    exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a
                    relative
                    age of the formations where they appear. Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a
                    hundred
                    years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession
                    developed
                    independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the
                    uncertainties
                    of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in
                    sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time.

                <h2>Absolute dating</h2>
                <p>Geologists also use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events.
                    These dates
                    are useful on their own and may also be used in conjunction with relative dating methods or to
                    calibrate
                    relative methods.
                </p>
                <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, advancement in geological science was facilitated by the
                    ability to
                    obtain accurate absolute dates to geological events using radioactive isotopes and other methods.
                    This
                    changed the understanding of geological time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and
                    stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it
                    became
                    possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil
                    sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute
                    ages.
                </p>
                <p>For many geological applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals
                    that give
                    the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature,
                    the point
                    at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice. These
                    are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium–lead
                    dating,
                    potassium–argon dating, argon–argon dating and uranium–thorium dating. These methods are used for a
                    variety
                    of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can
                    provide
                    absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate
                    relative
                    dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement.
                    Thermochemical
                    techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain
                    ranges,
                    and paleo-topography.
                </p>
                <p>Fractionation of the lanthanide series elements is used to compute ages since rocks were removed from
                    the
                    mantle.
                </p>
                <p>Other methods are used for more recent events. Optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic
                    radionuclide
                    dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. Dendrochronology can also be used for the
                    dating of
                    landscapes. Radiocarbon dating is used for geologically young materials containing organic
                    carbon.</p>
