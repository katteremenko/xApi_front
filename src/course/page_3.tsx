                <h2>Plate tectonics</h2>
                <p>In the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid
                    uppermost
                    portion of the upper mantle, is separated into tectonic plates that move across the plastically
                    deforming,
                    solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. This theory is supported by several types of
                    observations, including seafloor spreading and the global distribution of mountain terrain and
                    seismicity.</p>
                <p>There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of
                    the
                    mantle (that is, the heat transfer caused by the bulk movement of molecules within fluids). Thus,
                    oceanic
                    plates and the adjoining mantle convection currents always move in the same direction â€“ because the
                    oceanic
                    lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This
                    coupling
                    between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate
                    tectonics.</p>
                <p>The development of plate tectonics has provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid
                    Earth.
                    Long linear regions of geologic features are explained as plate boundaries.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, are
                        seen as
                        divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart.
                    </li>
                    <li>Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes are theorized as convergent boundaries, where one plate
                        subducts, or
                        moves, under another.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas Fault system, resulted in widespread powerful
                    earthquakes.
                    Plate tectonics also has provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in
                    which
                    the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving
                    force
                    for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of
                    the
                    theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single
                    theory of
                    how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.</p>

                    <p>Advances in seismology, computer modeling, and mineralogy and crystallography at high
                        temperatures and
                        pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.</p>
                    <p>Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the
                        Earth. Early
                        advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not
                        able to
                        propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered
                        model of the
                        Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic
                        discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More
                        recently,
                        seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the
                        same way a
                        doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the
                        interior of the
                        Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.</p>
                    <p>Mineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and
                        modeling studies
                        alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in
                        experimental
                        settings and measure changes in crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes
                        associated
                        with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures
                        expected in
                        the inner core of the Earth.</p>
