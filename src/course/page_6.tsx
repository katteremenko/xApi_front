                Geological Development of an Area
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>The geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and
                    deformational
                    processes change their shapes and locations.
                </p>
                <p>Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the overlying
                    rock.
                    Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into
                    sedimentary
                    rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows blanket the surface. Igneous
                    intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock,
                    and
                    crystallize as they intrude.
                </p>
                <p>After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or
                    metamorphosed.
                    Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or
                    side-to-side
                    (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent
                    boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.
                </p>

                <p>When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because
                    rock units,
                    other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary
                    ways: through
                    faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults
                    form, which
                    causes the deeper rock to move on top of the shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older,
                    as noted by
                    the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones.
                    Movement along
                    faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers
                    are dragged
                    along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave
                    plastically and
                    fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of
                    the fold
                    buckles upwards, creating "antiforms", or where it buckles downwards, creating "synforms". If
                    the tops of
                    the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and
                    synclines,
                    respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an
                    overturned
                    anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction
                    is unknown,
                    they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms, and synforms.
                </p>
                <p>Even higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and
                    metamorphism
                    of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the mineral composition of the rocks; creates
                    a foliation,
                    or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress. This can remove signs of the
                    original
                    textures of the rocks, such as bedding in sedimentary rocks, flow features of lavas, and crystal
                    patterns in
                    crystalline rocks.
                </p>
                <p>Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily
                    accomplished
                    through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock
                    units that
                    are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units ending up below
                    older units.
                    Stretching of units can result in their thinning. In fact, at one location within the Maria Fold
                    and Thrust
                    Belt, the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon appears over a length of less than a
                    meter. Rocks
                    at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can
                    also pinch
                    into lenses, known as boudins, after the French word for "sausage" because of their visual
                    similarity.
                </p>
                <p>Where rock units slide past one another, strike-slip faults develop in shallow regions, and
                    become shear
                    zones at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely.
                </p>
                <p>The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during
                    deformation.
                    Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients,
                    causing material
                    on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These
                    sediments
                    are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains
                    the
                    topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment and continues to create accommodation
                    space for
                    the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and
                    igneous activity.
                    Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below.
                    Dikes, long,
                    planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in
                    areas that are
                    being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that
                    are
                    observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.
                </p>
                <p>All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment and do not necessarily
                    occur in a
                    single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic
                    lava flows. The
                    sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the
                    southwestern United
                    States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since
                    Cambrian
                    time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States,
                    sedimentary,
                    volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older
                    rocks, such
                    as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the
                    world have
                    been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is indiscernible without laboratory analysis.
                    In
                    addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the
                    southwestern United
                    States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and
                    then
                    deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock
                    emplacement
                    and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a
                    guide to
                    understanding the geological history of an area.</p>
