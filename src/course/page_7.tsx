                <h2>Economic geology</h2>
                <p>Economic geology is a branch of geology that deals with aspects of economic minerals that humankind
                    uses to
                    fulfill various needs. Economic minerals are those extracted profitably for various practical uses.
                    Economic
                    geologists help locate and manage the Earth's natural resources, such as petroleum and coal, as well
                    as
                    mineral resources, which include metals such as iron, copper, and uranium.</p>

                <h2>Mining geology</h2>
                <p>Mining geology consists of the extractions of mineral resources from the Earth. Some resources of
                    economic
                    interests include gemstones, metals such as gold and copper, and many minerals such as asbestos,
                    perlite,
                    mica, phosphates, zeolites, clay, pumice, quartz, and silica, as well as elements such as sulfur,
                    chlorine,
                    and helium.</p>

                <h2>Petroleum geology</h2>
                <p>Petroleum geologists study the locations of the subsurface of the Earth that can contain extractable
                    hydrocarbons, especially petroleum and natural gas. Because many of these reservoirs are found in
                    sedimentary basins, they study the formation of these basins, as well as their sedimentary and
                    tectonic
                    evolution and the present-day positions of the rock units.</p>

                <h2>Engineering geology</h2>
                <p>Engineering geology is the application of geological principles to engineering practice for the
                    purpose of
                    assuring that the geological factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation, and
                    maintenance of engineering works are properly addressed.</p>
                <p>In the field of civil engineering, geological principles and analyses are used in order to ascertain
                    the
                    mechanical principles of the material on which structures are built. This allows tunnels to be built
                    without
                    collapsing, bridges and skyscrapers to be built with sturdy foundations, and buildings to be built
                    that will
                    not settle in clay and mud.</p>

                <h2>Hydrology and environmental issues</h2>
                <p>Geology and geological principles can be applied to various environmental problems such as stream
                    restoration, the restoration of brownfields, and the understanding of the interaction between
                    natural
                    habitat and the geological environment. Groundwater hydrology, or hydrogeology, is used to locate
                    groundwater, which can often provide a ready supply of uncontaminated water and is especially
                    important
                    in arid regions, and to monitor the spread of contaminants in groundwater wells.</p>
                <p>Geologists also obtain data through stratigraphy, boreholes, core samples, and ice cores. Ice cores
                    and
                    sediment cores are used for paleoclimate reconstructions, which tell geologists about past and
                    present
                    temperature, precipitation, and sea level across the globe. These datasets are our primary source of
                    information on global climate change outside of instrumental data.</p>

                <h2>Natural hazards</h2>
                <p>Geologists and geophysicists study natural hazards in order to enact safe building codes and warning
                    systems
                    that are used to prevent loss of property and life. Examples of important natural hazards that are
                    pertinent
                    to geology (as opposed those that are mainly or only pertinent to meteorology) are:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Avalanches</li>
                    <li>Earthquakes</li>
                    <li>Floods</li>
                    <li>Landslides and debris flows</li>
                    <li>River channel migration and avulsion</li>
                    <li>Rockfalls</li>
                    <li>Sinkholes</li>
                    <li>Soil liquefaction</li>
                    <li>Subsidence</li>
                    <li>Tsunamis</li>
                    <li>Volcanoes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </>
